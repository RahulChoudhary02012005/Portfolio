        <h4>Touch Screen</h4>
        <img src="./module4 img/Screenshot 2024-04-21 153336.png" alt="Day 1 Activity"><br>
        <p>A Full Colour Touchscreen gives you the best experience while using the printer. You can see the preview of the
        file being printed, and all important metrics right on the printer itself. 3D Printing has never been easier.
        </p>
        <h4>Direct Extruder</h4>
        <img src="./module4 img/Screenshot 2024-04-21 153415.png" alt="Day 1 Activity"><br>
       <p> A Direct Drive extruder applies maximum pushing force to the
        printing filament with accurate extrusion and retraction
        response for best print quality.
        This extruder is essential for printing Flexible Materials which
        wouldn’t be possible without it.</p>
        <h3>Filament</h3>
        <img src="./module4 img/filament.jpg" alt="Day 1 Activity"><br>
       <p>Here We use WOL 3D Filament PLA PRO+ (1.75mm, daisy white)</p>
        <h3>Ultimaker Cura Software</h3>
        <img src="./module4 img/3d.jpg" alt="Day 1 Activity">
        <img src="./module4 img/ultimaker-cura-open-source-free-slicing-software.jpg" alt="Day 1 Activity"><br>
       <p> Ultimaker Cura is a free, open-source software widely used for slicing 3D models and preparing them for 3D
        printing. Developed by Ultimaker, a prominent manufacturer of 3D printers, Cura supports a wide range of 3D
        printers, not just Ultimaker machines. Here's a brief overview of its features:
        <br>
        Slicing: Cura takes 3D models in STL, OBJ, or other formats and slices them into thin horizontal layers,
        generating the toolpaths that the 3D printer will follow.
        <br> Customization: Users can customize print settings such as layer height, infill density, print speed, and
        support structures to achieve the desired print quality and properties.
        <br> Preview: Cura provides a visual preview of the sliced model, allowing users to inspect each layer and
        identify potential issues before printing.
        <br> Multiple Printer Support: While Ultimaker Cura is developed by Ultimaker, it supports a wide range of 3D
        printers from various manufacturers, making it a versatile option for many users.
        <br> Plugin System: Cura features a plugin system that allows users to extend its functionality with additional
        features and tools.
        <br>Community and Updates: Ultimaker Cura benefits from an active user community, which contributes to its
        ongoing development and improvement. Regular updates ensure that the software stays current with the latest
        advancements in 3D printing technology.
        <br>Overall, Ultimaker Cura is a powerful, user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of preparing 3D models
        for printing, making it accessible to beginners while offering advanced features for experienced users.
